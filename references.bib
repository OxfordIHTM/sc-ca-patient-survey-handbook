the Institute of Medicine ({IOM}) to improve health care quality. Performance
Measurement offers a comprehensive review of available measures and
introduces a new framework to examine these measures against the six
aims of the health care system: health care should be safe, effective,
patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable. This new book also
addresses the gaps in performance measurement and introduces the need
for measures that are longitudinal, comprehensive, population-based, and
patient-centered. This book is directed toward all concerned with improving
the quality and performance of the nation's health care system in its
multiple dimensions and in both the public and private sectors.},

	doi = {10.1016/s1549-3741(04)30040-7},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Consumers care about the quality of medical care but do not pay attention to currently available quality information or use it to make more  informed health care choices. According to the theory of constructed preferences,  when people are in a situation that is both complex and unfamiliar, they likely  do not have fixed ideas about what is important to them. This theory seems to  describe the situation of consumers and comparative quality information. The  alternative would be to help consumers understand the overall concept of quality  and the different elements that make up quality of care. The Institute of  Medicine ({IOM}) report Crossing the Quality Chasm provides a framework for  understanding, measuring, and evaluating the quality of medical care. {IMPACT} {OF}  {PROVIDING} A {FRAMEWORK} {FOR} {UNDERSTANDING} {QUALITY}: Focus groups were conducted in  2001 to determine what performance information they would like to see to help  them select a physician. The findings indicated that consumers' understanding of  health care quality information was expanded to include a broader array of  factors when a cogent framework was used to present quality information. {USING}  {THE} {IOM} {FRAMEWORK} {FOR} {ALL} {PUBLIC} {REPORTING} {ON} {QUALITY}: The {IOM} framework or a  modified version should be used for all public reporting on health care quality.  The consistent use of some or all of the six {IOM} categories of performance  reporting will reinforce the message that this is what constitutes high-quality  care and it is what the public should expect to know when they make health care  choices.},

	abstract = {The extent to which individual and structural factors inﬂuence cancer patients’ reports of their experiences are not yet well understood. We sought to identify which groups of patients consistently report poorer experiences and whether structural care factors might also be associated with better or worse reports. We conducted a systematic review of literature in {PubMed} and Web of Science with the date of last search as 27th of February 2022 following {PRISMA} guidelines. We focused on studies from three established population-based surveys datasets and instruments. After screening 303 references, 54 studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, being from an ethnic minority group, having a more deprived socioeconomic status, poorer general or mental health status, being diagnosed with poor prognosis cancers, presenting to care through an emergency route, and having delayed treatment were consistently associated with poorer cancer care experiences. Conversely being diagnosed with earlier stage disease, perceiving communication as effective, positive patient-provider relationships, and receiving treatment with respect were overall associated with better reports of cancer care experiences. Improvement efforts aimed at delivering better experiences of patient-centred care need to take account much more explicitly patients’ differing characteristics, prognoses, and trajectories they take through their care journeys.},

	abstract = {Health service coverage is considered as a concept expressing the extent of interaction between the service and the people for whom it is intended, this  interaction not being limited to a particular aspect of service provision but  ranging over the whole process from resource allocation to achievement of the  desired objective. For the measurement of coverage, several key stages are first  identified, each of them involving the realization of an important condition for  providing the service; a coverage measure is then defined for each stage, namely  the ratio between the number of people for whom the condition is met and the  target population, so that a set of these measures represents the interaction  between the service and the target population. This definition of coverage allows  for variations, which are called "specific coverage", by limiting the target  population to specific subgroups differentiated by certain conditions related to  service provision or by demographic or socioeconomic factors.The evaluation of  coverage on the basis of these concepts enables management to identify  bottlenecks in the operation of the service, to analyse the constraining factors  responsible for such bottlenecks, and to select effective measures for service  development.},
