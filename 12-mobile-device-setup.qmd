# Mobile device setup {#sec-mobile-device-setup}

Mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablets have become valuable tools in data collection. Various applications have been and are being developed specifically to harness the utility of mobile devices for collecting data. An understanding of how mobile devices work specifically those powered by [Android operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system))\index{Android} is therefore a requisite knowledge for anyone involved in a data collection campaign that utilises these devices for data collection. This tutorial gives a brief overview on how to get started with an Android\index{Android} device. We chose to focus on the use of tablet devices because we think that the smaller sized tablets (up to 7-inch) are a good mix of the mobility and handiness of a mobile phone and the wider screen size of a tablet which is good for fitting relatively dense question sets adequately. We also chose to focus on Samsung-branded\index{Samsung} because they are probably the most common brand of mobile devices available and we think most users have most likely had an experience using devices from this brand beforehand. We use the [Samsung SM-T230](https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/model/SM-T230NZWAAUT/) as the model device for instructional purposes.

## Charging the battery {#sec-charging-battery}
Before using the device for the first time or when the battery has been unused for extended periods, you must charge the battery.

Connect the USB cable to the USB power adaptor and then plug the end of the USB cable into the multipurpose jack.

![Charging the device](images/samsung_03.png){#fig-samsung-charging fig-alt="Charging the Samsung SM-T230" fig-align="center" width="70%"}

* The device can be used while it is charging, but it may take longer to fully charge the battery.
* If the device receives an unstable power supply while charging, the touch screen may not function. If this happens, unplug the charger from the device.
* While charging, the device may heat up. This is normal and should not affect the device's lifespan or performance. If the battery gets hotter than usual, the charger may stop charging.

After fully charging, disconnect the device from the charger.

Your device provides options that help you save the battery power. By customising these options and deactivating features in the background, you can use the device longer between charges:

* When you are not using the device, switch to sleep mode by pressing the Power button.
* Close unnecessary applications with the task manager.
* Deactivate the Bluetooth feature.
* Deactivate the WiFi feature.
* Deactivate auto-syncing of applications.
* Decrease the backlight time.
* Decrease the brightness of the display.


## Turning the device on and off {#sec-device-on-off}
When turning on the device for the first time, follow the on-screen instructions to setup your device.

Press and hold the Power button for a few seconds to turn on the device.

![Turning off the device](images/samsung_04.png){#fig-samsung-turning-off fig-alt="Turning off the Samsung SM-T230" fig-align="center" width="70%"}

To turn off the device, press and hold the Power button, and then tap Power off.


## Locking and unlocking the device {#sec-device-lock}
When not in use, lock the device to prevent unwanted operation. Pressing the Power button turns off the screen and puts the device into lock mode. The device automatically gets locked if it is not used for a specific period.

The steps to unlocking the device depends on the lock screen settings of the mobile device. By default, the **swipe** method will unlock the screen. This is done by pressing the Power button or Home button when the touch screen is turned off, tapping anywhere on the screen, and then swiping on the touch screen in any direction. See @sec-lock-screen-settings to learn more about the other lock screen methods.


## Configuring devices for data collection {#sec-configure-device}
It is important to configure mobile devices such as mobile phones or tablets that are going to be used for data collection. From the point of view of a **survey lead** or **survey manager**, it will be important that the devices are configured in such a way that:

* Prevents inappropriate use by enumerators;
* Conserves the battery power of the device; and,
* Maximises its use for data collection.

### Go to settings {#sec-go-to-settings}

On your tablet device, tap on the *Settings* app (@fig-settings-app).

You will then see the following on your tablet screen (@fig-settings-menu). There are four (4) tabs on top of the screen named **Connections**; **Device**; **Controls**; and **General**. These are the four settings categories that can be configured as needed.

Android device settings
:::

### Configure the Connections settings {#sec-connections-settings}

Under the **Connections** tab (@fig-connections-menu), the following settings should be configured:

![Connections menu](images/samsung_07.png){#fig-connections-menu fig-alt="The connections settings menu" fig-align="center" width="50%"}

* **Wi-Fi (1)** - this should be set to OFF during the data collection process. When ON, the device keeps on scanning for Wi-Fi networks that are available

* **Bluetooth (2)** - the Bluetooth\index{Bluetooth} should be set to OFF during the data collection process. When Bluetooth is ON, the device keeps on scanning for Bluetooth devices to connect to. This continuous scanning will drain the batter device very quickly.

* **Location (3)** - this should be set to ON during the data collection process if you will be collecting GPS coordinates.

* **Nearby devices (4)** - this should be set to OFF. This settings uses near-field communication (NFC) to communicate with other devices that are NFC-enabled. Just like Bluetooth, when turned ON, the device will keep on scanning to look for devices to connect to which will drain the battery device very quickly.

### Configure the Device settings {#sec-device-settings}

Tap on the **Device** tab.

#### Sound and display settings {#sec-sound-display-settings}

The first settings to configure will be the **Sound and Display** (@fig-sound-settings).

![Sound settings](images/samsung_08.png){#fig-sound-settings fig-alt="The sound settings menu" fig-align="center" width="50%"}

For **Sound (1)**, the most relevant settings to configure will be whether you would want to get sound-based feedback when you interact with the device such as touching the screen and making selections **(2)** and when you lock or unlock the device **(3)**. These settings are checked by default as most users prefer some form of feedback when they tap on the screen or when they lock or unlock the screen. Uncheck this option if you prefer not to have these sounds on. These settings have very little effect on the device battery life and is more a matter of preference.

#### Display settings {#sec-display-settings}

Next, tap on **Display (1)** settings under the **Device** tab settings (@fig-display-settings).

![Display settings](images/samsung_09.png){#fig-display-settings fig-alt="The display settings menu" fig-align="center" width="50%"}

The following settings can be configured here:

* **Brigthness (2)** - this should be configured as needed but ideally should be set to no more than middle level brightness. Make sure that screen brigthness is not set to maximum at any point as this will drain the battery device very quickly.

* **Screen timeout (3)** - this setting determine how long the screen stays on when device is not in use. This should be set to about 10 minutes of inactivity. This is just about enough time for enumerators to ask questions and get a response and then record on the device without the screen going OFF and then the device going on lock.

* **Daydream (4)** - this is the screensaver for these devices. This should be turned OFF because when activated, a screen saver turns on when the device is inactive instead of the screen turning OFF and getting locked. This causes battery device drainage.

* **Display batter percentage (5)** - this should be checked. This will help enumerators to determine whether their devices have enough power or not.

#### Multi window settings {#sec-multi-window-settings}

Next tap on **Multi window (1)** settings (@fig-multi-window-settings). This should be unchecked **(2)**. For the purposes of data collection, there is no use for the multi window functionality.

![Multi window settings](images/samsung_10.png){#fig-multi-window-settings fig-alt="The multi window settings menu" fig-align="center" width="50%"}

#### Lock screen settings {#sec-lock-screen-settings}

Next tap on the **Lock screen (1)** settings (@fig-lock-screen-settings). Under this setting, there are three main things we need to configure.

![Lock screen settings](images/samsung_11.png){#fig-lock-screen-settings fig-alt="The lock screen settings menu" fig-align="center" width="50%"}

The **Owner information (2)** setting would be good to configure because this allows you to name the device you are setting up. This is especially important when you are managing multiple devices for data collection and you need to identify one device from the other so you know what device goes to which
enumerator and other management task.

The **Unlock effect (3)** setting should also be configured to **None**. This setting ensures that unlocking of the device is quick and easy without unnecessary effects.

The **Screen Security** setting should be configured as this provides a layer of security on the mobile device that will enable only authorised users to access the contents of the mobile device and add/change settings of the mobile device. There are currently five options for screen security: **none**, **swipe (default)**, **pattern**, **PIN**, and **password**. It is recommended to set a screen lock method of either a pattern, PIN, or password. @fig-screen-lock shows an example of a screen lock pattern security for a mobile device.

![Screen lock pattern example](images/screen_lock.png){#fig-screen-lock fig-alt="Example of a screen lock pattern" fig-align="center" width="50%"}

#### Font settings {#sec-font-settings}

Now, tap on **Font** setting (@fig-font-settings).

![Font settings](images/samsung_12.png){#fig-font-settings fig-alt="The font settings menu" fig-align="center" width="50%"}

Here, there is one key setting to consider and that is the **Font size**. You should consider the best font size that would make the text of the device easier to read for enumerators. The device defaults to **Medium** which is generally a good font size to use. Change this font size if you think a bigger or smaller
font would be necessary.

### 4. Configure the Controls settings {#sec-controls-settings}

Now, tap on the **Controls** settings tab on top of the screen.

#### Language and input settings {#sec-language-input-settings}

The first setting to configure is the **Language and input (1)** settings (@fig-language-input-settings).

![Language and input settings](images/samsung_13.png){#fig-language-input-settings fig-alt="The language and input settings menu" fig-align="center" width="50%"}

The language used in the device can be configured to the language that is most appropriate for the data collection. When the **Language (2)** setting is set to a particular language, the device uses that language throughout the device. In this example, the device is set to **English (United Kingdom)**.

The next setting is **Keyboards and input methods**. By default, Samsung devices uses the Samsung keyboard. However, there are various keyboard applications now available that provide much better keyboard input than the default Samsung keyboard. We recommend the use of **SwiftKey keyboard** as the layout of the keyboard is much better than the Samsung keyboard which allows for much accurate text entry.

To be able to enable SwiftKey\index{SwiftKey}, you first need to download and install the SwiftKey application from the [Google Play Store]((https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey&hl=en_GB&pli=1)) or [sideload](https://www.howtogeek.com/313433/how-to-sideload-apps-on-android/)\index{sideload} it using an APK\index{APK} file. Once installed, the SwiftKey keyboard option now becomes available in the **Keyboards and input methods (4)** settings. This keyboard option can now be checked. Checking this keyboard option
includes SwiftKey keyboard as a keyboard choice for the user. To make it default, tap on the **Default** setting of the **Keyboards and input methods**, and then select SwiftKey as the default keyboard **(3)**.

#### Palm motion settings {#sec-palm-motion-settings}

Now, set the **Palm motion (1)** setting (@fig-palm-motion-settings).

![Palm motion settings](images/samsung_14.png){#fig-palm-motion-settings fig-alt="The palm motion settings menu" fig-align="center" width="50%"}

Turn off the setting for both **Capture screen (2)** and **Mute/Pause (3)** setting. This avoids enumerators unintentioally activating this gesture input which can confuse them on what to do next.

#### Smart screen settings {#sec-smart-screen0-settings}

Now, set the **Smart Screen (1)** settings (@fig-smart-screen-settings).

![Smart screen settings](images/samsung_15.png){#fig-smart-screen-settings fig-alt="The smart screen settings menu" fig-align="center" width="50%"}

You should uncheck the **Smart stay (1)** option. Whilst this setting is a clever functionality, this can drain the battery device much quicker because it utilises the front camera to determine whether the user is looking at the screen or not.

### Configure the General settings {#sec-general-settings}

Next, tap on the **General** settings tab.

#### Accounts settings {#sec-accounts-settings}

The **Accounts (1)** setting is the first to configure (@fig-accounts-settings).

![Accounts settings](images/samsung_16.png){#fig-accounts-settings fig-alt="The accounts settings menu" fig-align="center" width="50%"}

If you have already configured your device with a Google account, you should see under the **Accounts** section the Google icon **(2)**. If not, this is the time to add your Google account. Click on **Add account** and then follow the instructions after that.

Other accounts can be added here. However, for purposes of data collection, there is no for these other accounts unless your data collection campaigns requires any other accounts setup in your device.

#### Date and time settings {#sec-date-time-settings}

Now, we should set the **Date and time** settings (@fig-date-time-settings).

![Date and time settings](images/samsung_17.png){#fig-date-time-settings fig-alt="The date and time settings menu" fig-align="center" width="50%"}

It would be important to set the **Date and time** settings of the device appropriately. This is relevant to data collection because some forms that collects dates uses the date and time of the device to determine what the current date and time is. If these settings are not set correctly, then the recorded date and time in the forms will also be incorrect.

#### Application manager settings {#sec-application-manager-settings}

Next, tap on the **Application manager** (@fig-application-manager-settings).

![Application manager settings](images/samsung_18.png){#fig-application-manager-settings fig-alt="The application manager settings menu" fig-align="center" width="50%"}

This setting allows you to disable or uninstall certain applications that is not really needed for your data collection. It is recommended that you disable or uninstall any applications installed on the device that will not be used by the enumerators for data collection. Doing so prevents unintended use of the device
by the enumerators and ensures that the battery of the device is conserved and used only for data collection as much as possible.

It should be noted however that certain applications come pre-installed by the brand manufacturers. For some of these, they cannot be uninstalled or disabled as they have been hard set to stay on the device.

#### Power saving mode settings {#sec-power-saving-settings}

Next, tap on **Power saving mode (1)** settings (@fig-power-saving-settings).

![Power saving mode settings](images/samsung_19.png){#fig-power-saving-settings fig-alt="The power saving mode settings menu" fig-align="center" width="50%"}

The **CPU Performance (2)** option can be checked. Data collection doesn't require great CPU performance at all and definitely will not require maximum performance at any point. This will increase battery life of the device.
